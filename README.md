## Objectives
Create an app that runs in the command line to log employees, roles, and departments in a database. Each employee is assigned an ID, role, and manager. If the employee is a manger, then the manager is listed as "null" in the database. Each role is assigned an ID, title, and salary. Each department is assigned an ID and name. The user is able to view employees, roles, and departments. The user can also add employees, roles and departments. An additional feature lets the user update an employee's role.
